               This is easy and fun sport if you love being shot at. If you want
               to start playing paint then there are some things you should know
               about before you start playing and you will learn some fun facts.
               Americans own approximately 270 million guns, which gives America
               the highest rate of gun ownership with, 89 guns for every 100 
               people.The company Daisy Outdoor Products sold windmills and gave
               a complementary BB guns with every purchase. The BB guns became 
               so popular that they stopped selling windmills and started 
               selling BB guns.SourceOver the past 50 years, gun owners have 
               been responsible for over $2 billion in wildlife conservation in
               the United States due to 10% tax on guns and ammo.President
               Garfield’s assassin purchased the gun that he thought would look 
               good in a museum.Russians astronauts take guns into  space to 
               protect themselves against bears if they land off-course.The city
               of Kennesaw, Georgia has a law that every head of household must 
               own a gun.There is only one legally operated gun store in all of 
               Mexico. SourceJackie Chan used to  carry multiple guns and even a
               grenade to protect himself and  other artists from the Triad in 
               the 80s and 90s. The Soviet Union designed a machine gun 
               (GSh-6-30) with such a recoil that it damaged the plane it was
               mounted on. Fuel tanks ruptured, parts fell off, and electronic 
               circuits took damage. At least three crashes were attributed to 
               just using this gun.The recoil on the A-10’s Gatling gun
               (GAU-8) is 10,000 pounds of force -“…slightly more than the 
               output of one of the A-10’s two TF34 engines.” The Nazis created 
               a weapon called the Gustav Gun, and it is the largest gun ever 
               built weighing over 1300 tons and capable of hitting a target 23 
               miles away. Jailers used to have keys that doubled as single-fire
               guns as a last resort for self-defense. The revolver was first 
               created by Samuel Colt when he was 16 years old.There is a pistol
               called the Armatix Smart System iP1. The Pistol won’t fire unless
               a radio-signal watch is located within 40 cm of the pistol, and 
               the watch won’t activate unless a finger print and a PIN code are
               entered into it.TASER is short for ‘Thomas A Swift’s Electric 
               Rifle’
