              3 Interesting Things You Didn’t Know About American History.

George Washington was the first President of the liberty-loving nation, and The 
Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. Both of these comprise rather 
well-known events throughout the course of American history. But there’s a 
wealth of hidden history nuggets that you might not know about. Here are ten of
them.The Founding Fathers penned the first couple of drafts of the Declaration 
of Independence on hemp paper, since at the time at least 75 percent of all the 
world’s paper was made from cannabis hemp fiber. The democratic delegates eked 
out the document’s first and second drafts—completed on June 28th and July 2nd 
1776, respectively—on Dutch hemp paper. The final document had a more official 
air, though, as it was printed on parchment.Months before World War Two 
culminated in the absolute decimation of Hiroshima, the Japanese found 
themselves in a bit of a pinch. Making the most of the strong air current across
the Pacific Ocean, the Japanese crafted what was likely the first 
intercontinental weapon system and attached bombs to hydrogen balloons, in what 
was known as the Fu-Go campaign.The Liberty Bell is an iconic American relic. 
Unfortunately, its tolling hasn’t been heard since George Washington’s Birthday 
in 1846. The bell, which used to reside in Pennsylvania’s Independence Hall, 
was erected in August 1752 and was first rung in July 8, 1776, to celebrate the
first public reading of the Declaration of Independence.
